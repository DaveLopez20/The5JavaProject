    <h2>This class so far was interesting because I was used to HTML and CSS that I did not think much on javascript. When I first use Java it turned out to be one of the most interesting things I've learned since I learned how to make functions, create a clock, and even a functioning game. I hope to you all to have a great christmas break. </h2>
